<p>Read and study the following chapter of Malik.</p>
<ul>
<li>pointers, classes (you may skip the virtual function and abstract classes part. We will get to them in CS261 along with inheritance)</li>
</ul>
<p>We will focus on pointer and dynamic memory for this week.</p>
<p>The memory check code in the online sample code assumes visual studio environment. You need to comment it out on linux. To check memory leak on linux, you can use valgrind:</p>
<pre>valgrind --tool=memcheck your-executable-file (by default it is a.out)<br /><br />Here is a quick start guide for valgrind: <a href="http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/QuickStart.html" target="_blank">valgrind quick start guide</a><br /><br />At this point, you should also learn about writing your own makefile and using gdb, the debugger: </pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://mrbook.org/tutorials/make/" target="_blank">A makefile tutorial</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.unknownroad.com/rtfm/gdbtut/gdbtoc.html" target="_blank">A gdb tutorial</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When you feel you have a good grasp of the concepts of this module you should start working on Project 4 and lab 5.</p>
<p><a href="avi/formatting.wmv" target="_self"></a>However, before you begin I recommend you view the videos I put together which review some of the concepts of this module and give you hints about the lab.</p>
<p>As always, it is essential that your coding style follows the style guidelines for this class, which you can find <a href="../module1/styleGuide.doc" target="_self"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">here</span></a>. Use of good style and good program design is a requirement for a good score on each assignment.</p>
<p>Finally, don't forget you need to complete the on-line quiz 5 by the published due date. As before, you will have 2 possible attempts to complete this, and your highest score is the one that counts.</p>
